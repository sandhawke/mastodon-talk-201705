W3C Tech Talk

A: Will this take over the world?
+++
Quite Possibly

---

Can the technology scale to everyone on the planet?
 Yes, like email
 - load on server depends on number of people hosted at that server
   and how active they are in their communications.
 - hosting costs of mastodon.social are $0.03 per user per year

---

What are some short term problems Mastodon growth faces, and what can we do about them?
 - social climate, with very conflicting goals
 - volunteer sysadmins
 - narrow vision
 - no professional staff, PR, etc
 - politics of search
 - protocols shortcomings re: private messages, private groups
 - weakness of instance=community model

---

W3C Stds & Mastodon
 - Mastodon built on OStatus
 - Key folks behind OStatus went on the make ActivityPub which is W3C CR
 - Mastodon devs have started implementing ActivityPub support, especially
   for the group and private message support

---

W3C Community & Mastodon
 - Should W3C run an instance?
 - discussion of W3C news/events (for people who avoid Twitter)
 - Helps show it's "real" and suitable for business
 - possible custom integrations (can be done by 3rd parties)
    - github events? (subscribe to commits, issues, comments)
    - meeting records? (subscribe to Proposed/Resolved)
 - social.w3.org or community.w3.org or mastodon.w3.org

## Do Folks Want Bridging?

 - Inbound: use Mastodon as feed reader: rss/atom, reddit, twitter, facebook
 - Outbound: post to Mastodon and you're blogging, tweeting, etc
 - Combined: Like/Comment/Share could be bridged in+out of twitter/facebook
 - But is it necessary?   Maybe it'll have its own good-enough content
   (This was what led Eric Ries to propose "Lean Startup")

## Algorithmic Feeds

 - Nothing yet
 - Sliders: let's have a smart mixing board, that users control
 - Also set the boundaries of who you can interact with; put a safety wall
   around your social graph, if you want
